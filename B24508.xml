            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </gap> this Monkey was alwayes a cunning Jugler, so that when Souldiers ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> received their pay, when there hands were in her placket, her hands woul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be in there pockets, and though they felt the Monkey at the very same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, yet they had not the power to take such sure hold of her as to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her before a Magistrate, but she would cunningly slip away from them and leave them no money in their pockets, nor any thing in their hands but a rusty musket or a pike, for she would get away to bed and laugh next day with open mouth to think how she had guld the souldiers, so that the souldiers cried a pox on this Monney, we can never keep any money for this She Monkey. If she went to Church she was alwayes close vaild like a Nun, and when she was in the most holy picture of praying, though her mouth many times opened, yet she could not pray by the spirit but would hold her peace or else the desires of her mumping minde were that such or such a young man were preaching in her pulpit, and indeed many Schollers and preachers after service was done did love to handle the Monkey better then they did their text, and it is thought that some of them would never have married if it had not been for love of the Monkey.</p>
            <p>But amongst other tricks that hindered this Monkeys marriage, that was one chief matter, she could never keep her legs together, but would throw them abroad in such an obscene manner, that any of the Cavaleers with a Carbine charged with two bullets might easily enter her maiden
<pb facs="tcp:197107:3"/> Fort, rifle all the treasures of her virginity, and come off safe and sound with a pox to them, and so she would be revenged of her enemies; for many of the Caveleers that were malignants to the Parliament, were more beaten and foiled by this Monkey then by all their forces, so that their bones in the language of diseases cryed <hi>peccavi,</hi> or a pox of Prince <hi>Roberts</hi> malignant Monkey. Her last trick was a very bad quality, and that was, when she was drunk she would let any one take up her smock, if she had it, and so discover her Monkey. Well, every dog hath his day, and every Monkey may get her match. It fortuned, that <hi>Cupid,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of the Cavaleers in <hi>Oxford,</hi> made him cast his eye, and with it his affection upon this Monkey, and though he could not finde any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular good quality in her, yet he loved her exceedingly in the whole, and most especially he doated upon her Monkey; after this, wooe her he did, and still when he was on horseback, or on on footback, he still thought upon his Monkey; once he drew out his sword at <hi>Grises</hi> Taverne in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and the close shutting of the Oister, and the opening of it afterward, made him think of his beloved Monkey; then he would drink healths, and swear (God dam me) you shall pledge my Monkey, she is my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strisse, fill it all out Sir: But one day the Cavaleer having with too much familiarity angered the Monkey, she bit him very shrewdly, so that the Cavaleer grew exceeding sick, and afterward when he was recovered, he made this conceit on his Monkeys displeasure, and biting bitternesse:
<q>
                  <l>Monkey, nay fie, Why dost thou frown on me?</l>
                  <l>And will thy countenance never better be.</l>
                  <l>A pox upon thee and thy false fair looks,</l>
                  <l>In stead of favors thou givest me French knocks.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But love is a fire not to be quenched, for assoon as the hot Cavaleere was grown coole and healthfull, he desired again to be dealing with his Monkey, and drew a long Letter, the Contents whereof pleased her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding well, so that she resolved to be fast joyned in Matrimony to the Cavaleere, and the Cavaleere thought to cock his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, and match his Monkey. The wedding day was appointed to be kept in <hi>Nullibi</hi> Colledge or <hi>Broadgates</hi> Hall, a Dinner was provided, but the Monkey sat all dinner time very demure, and was so possest with the strong imagination of what shall be done at night, so that she could not eat a bit, but smiled inwardly to her self, to think how the Cavaleere

Now while the Cavaleere endeavoured to recover his strength again, the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key after she was married, began to play the second part of malignant ttricks: And first, she began to straggle abroad, and when she got loose, she would run to one Taverne or other with her Gossips, and there they would sit and drink, and condemne their husbands for being too slack in pleasing their Monkeys. For you must now suppose the Monkey was mad, because the Cavaleere did forbear to come on as he was wont to do; and because she would make the Cavaleere mad, she set a Cullender by her bed side, when she had occasion to make water, she took it and made her distillations therein, so that all her urine ran about the bed, and the Cavaleere lay souced in the Monkey salt pickle, so that her husband being extreamly vext after he had sworne two or three oaths, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">

               </gap> many farts he leaped out of bed, and left the Monkey to coole herself in the empty bed, but her bed was not long empty; for after the Cavaleer was gone, a Scholar of <hi>Oxford</hi> had a great desire to leave off poring in his book, and instead of plodding on the deep liberal Sciences, he had, minde to peep into the Monkeys black Art or Arse, and so accord as to former appointment the Scholar thought to have about with the Monkeys <hi>Nunquam Jatis,</hi> and thereupon slipt of his breeches and slipped into bed,
